               		We dream. That's who we are.
                	<br />
                	Down to our bones, our cells&hellip; 
                	<br />
                	that instinct to build,
                	<br />
                	that drive to seek beyond what we know.
                	<br />
                	It's in our DNA.
                	<br /><br />
                	We crossed the oceans, we conquered the skies,
                	<br />
                	and when there were no more frontiers on Earth,
                	<br />
                	we launched ourselves among the stars.
                	<br /><br />
                	We had come so far, overcome so many obstacles...
                	<br />
                	and there were times when our faith flagged...
                	<br />
                	We persevered...
                	<br />
                	There will be no exit...
                	<br />
                	And as we're preparing the next Phase, one thing is clear...
                	<br />
                	Our Dream is alive...
                	<br /><br />
                	We don&rsquo;t want to dwell in the past. 
                	<br />
                	Or harp on about what&rsquo;s wrong.
                	<br />
                	We want to fix things. Now, and for good.
                	<br />
                	When we say &lsquo;together&rsquo; we really do mean everyone. 
                	<br />
                	All of us.
                	<br /><br />
                	This is an evolution of an industry.
                	<br />
                	This is Epilen.
                	<br />
                	And we&rsquo;re changing everything
                	<br />
                	about how healthcare works.
