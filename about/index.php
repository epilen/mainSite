                        	Like many businesses that confront convention, Epilenâ€™s origin came from a simple place: 
                        	a belief that there had to be a better way to take care of people when they access healthcare.
                        	<br />
                        	That's why, with the technology to create a more intelligent solution and the compassion to 
                        	know that every person matters, we are delivering a connected healthcare experience for 
                        	everyone who wants the best care for themselves.
