    				We are building a system that empowers hospitals, doctors and patients. All of this is a good start, but is not sufficient to make a dent in the overall system. Our system is smart, but it’s not yet cheap. It’s more like a Tesla Model S than like a Model 3. 
    				<br /><br />
    				We have a long way to go in making what we do affordable for everyone, not just for the kinds of people who are fortunate enough to be in a position to spend money for better health. 
    				<br /><br />
    				Fortunately, the same technologies that make the system smarter also make it cheaper over time. Building efficiency and decreasing redundancy means we’ll be able to push our prices down as we help hospitals and doctors take care of more people at once. 
    				<br /><br />
    				Needless to say, we have a lot to learn and a lot to build. It won’t be easy, but we’re excited to try.
