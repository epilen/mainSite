            		Improving medicine by digitizing health care, increasing access and opening the way for truly personalized care where it is needed most.

           			We believe that in order to fundamentally improve our health care system, we have to start with the foundations: access to information and the factors that affects our decision making.
           			<br /><br />
           			So we're mining medical records in order to provide better and faster health services.
           			We're collaborating with Government bodies and Hospitals to develop an unprecedented, 
           			patient de-identified interface that brings altogether new health care experiences.
           			<br /><br />
           			We started Epilen to deliver better health to people. 
           			But if we had to do this by working within the existing healthcare system, 
           			we wouldn’t even know where to begin. How do we unwind everyone’s broken incentives, 
           			retrofit ancient software, and convince a bunch of people to change a system in 
           			which they benefit from the status quo? We felt it would make more sense to instead 
           			start from scratch and to build things the right way from the start.
