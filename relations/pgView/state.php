           			Health care is fragmented, and our own health information is not accessible or easy to understand. 
           			<br /><br />
           			The health-care industry has lagged behind sectors like real estate, retail and banking in the use of 
           			data. The trouble with healthcare is we've made it impossible for someone to find value in 
           			transacting their data in exchange for something truly remarkable. 
           			<br /><br />
           			Many services and products still have a "one size fits all" approach, but the decisions about your health are personal. You should be able to tailor it to your needs, and you should feel confident that 
           			youâ€™re making the best choices.
