            		Epilen aims to replace the patchwork of various software programs and tools—and even old-school methods 
            		like paper forms—that most hospitals piece together to manage their business. 
            		Instead, Epilen lets hospitals do everything through one system, which also connects doctors with 
            		patients through smartphone applications.
